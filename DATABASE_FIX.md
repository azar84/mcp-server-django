# Database Connection Fix for Heroku

## Problem
Your Django application on Heroku was experiencing "too many connections" errors with PostgreSQL:
```
django.db.utils.OperationalError: connection to server at "..." failed: FATAL: too many connections for role "..."
```

## Root Causes
1. **Persistent Connections**: `conn_max_age=600` was keeping connections open too long
2. **No Connection Pooling**: Django was creating new connections without proper pooling
3. **Heroku Limits**: Heroku's PostgreSQL plans have strict connection limits (typically 20 connections for basic plans)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Optimized Database Settings
- Disabled persistent connections (`conn_max_age=0`)
- Added connection pooling with strict limits
- Limited to 1 connection per dyno to prevent exhaustion

### 2. Added Connection Monitoring
- Created `DatabaseConnectionMonitoringMiddleware` to track connection usage
- Added detailed logging for database operations
- Monitors slow queries and connection counts

### 3. Enhanced Logging
- Added specific loggers for database operations
- Warning thresholds for high connection counts
- Performance monitoring for slow queries

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy the Changes
```bash
# Commit and push your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix database connection issues for Heroku"
git push heroku main
```

### 2. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check logs for any database errors
heroku logs --tail

# Test the application
curl https://your-app.herokuapp.com/admin/
```

### 3. Monitor Connection Usage
```bash
# Watch for database connection warnings
heroku logs --tail | grep "connection"
```

## Configuration Details

### Database Settings
- `conn_max_age=0`: No persistent connections
- `MAX_CONNS=1`: Maximum 1 connection per dyno
- `MAX_USAGE=100`: Recycle connections after 100 queries
- `BLOCK=True`: Block when pool is exhausted

### Monitoring
- Logs warnings when connection count > 5
- Logs slow queries taking > 2 seconds
- Tracks connection cleanup and errors

## Alternative Solutions (if issues persist)

### 1. Upgrade Database Plan
```bash
# Upgrade to Standard plan with more connections
heroku addons:upgrade heroku-postgresql:standard-0
```

### 2. Add Connection Pooler
```bash
# Add PgBouncer for connection pooling
heroku addons:create pgbouncer:basic
```

### 3. Optimize Queries
- Use `select_related()` and `prefetch_related()` to reduce queries
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Use database indexes for common queries

## Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Check database status
heroku pg:info

# Check connection count
heroku pg:ps

# View database logs
heroku logs --source postgres
```

## Expected Results
- No more "too many connections" errors
- Reduced database connection usage
- Better application stability
- Detailed monitoring of database operations
